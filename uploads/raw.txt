When it's dark 
When the sun goes down.
And the moon comes out to play.
The night is supposedly mystical
Unlike the bright, sunny day.
Since we were little,
We've heard tales about how,
The dark is filled with mystery.
"Goodnight my darling, off to sleep now!"
Once, long ago,
It was way past the middle of the night.
I found myself alone,
With some thoughts lingering on my mind.
Out in the open, I thought I would go,
I would clear my mind
Then maybe I'd sleep soon.
The quiet of the night,
Took over my mind.
And the gleam of the moonlight,
Brightened up my eyes.
Dark sheets of blue,
They were boundless and bare.
Hung pearls of white,
On this windy night.
Mystical? Mysterious?
None at all.
A concealed kind of beauty,
That came out after night-fall.
